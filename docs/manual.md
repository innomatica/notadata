## Things to Note

* Each item can have **multiple tags**. For eaxmple you may want to 
buy a bunch of broccoli either at Farm Boy or Food Basics.

* Checked (completed) items do not disappear by default. They are greyed out instead.
So you don't have to recreate broccoli entry every time.

* You can set up an alarm for each item. So you will be notified to pack some
masks for tomorrow when you get home.

* You can set up an alarm for each tag. You will be notified to do series of
chores in the Saturday morning.

You can create those at any time.
